# Linear Algebra Functions Project

This is mostly a proof of concept and me taking Julia out for a spin as I learn more and more about linear algebra.

The goal of this project is to provide a library containing several common linear algebra functions. Currently the only operation implemented so far is the Gram-Schmidt process, but more will be added very soon.
